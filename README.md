# Technical  Test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a technical test conducted in the context of torre.co, utilizing HTML, JavaScript, and React. It involves the creation of a web page that allows users to search for names and display a list of individuals matching the search criteria, drawing inspiration from the torre.ai search engine. Additionally, the page must provide an option for users to save or favorite individuals for easy future access.

## Features
- Name Search: Users can enter names into the search field, and the application, built using React, will dynamically display a list of individuals whose names match the search query.

- Save Favorites: The page allows users to save or mark individuals as favorites, and these selections are stored and easily accessible for users within the application.

- Genome View: Clicking on a search result redirects users to the corresponding genome page. This can be achieved either through direct integration with torre.ai or via a custom React-based implementation, based on the developer's choice.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- HTML5 and CSS3: Used for structuring and styling the web application.
  
- JavaScript: JavaScript is used for creating dynamic and interactive features within the application.

- React: The frontend of the application is built using the React library, enabling efficient state management and user interface development.

- The dependencies and libraries are managed using npm, the Node package manager.
